Across three regions, ZenTrust funded micro research plots that pair Indigenous knowledge with open sensors. Farmers record rainfall, soil moisture, and canopy cover, while students translate the data into planting calendars.

This rapid learning loop reduced crop losses by 18% during the last dry spell, and the datasets are free for nearby cooperatives to replicate.
