When the Anila river slowed to a trickle, families walked two hours for drinking water. ZenTrust partnered with local stewards to build living check-dams from willow and stone, capturing seasonal rains and rebuilding soil sponges. Within one year, seeps emerged and twelve springs returned.

Community hydrologists now monitor water quality with open-source sensors, sharing data in the TinaCMS-powered knowledge base. Farmers are planting shade-loving crops again, and children swim where dust once settled.
